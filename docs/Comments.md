In this project we have developed a RESTful web service using Python and the Flask microframework, using Flask-RESTful, a Flask extension that simplifies the creation of APIs.
## Intro
The task of designing a web service or API that adheres to the REST guidelines implies identifying the resources that will be exposed and how they will be affected by the methods.

We have built a To-Do list app that will be used in a local environment. To run, simply activate the virtual environment and then run the app by doing:

```python
source environment/bin/activate
export FLASK_APP=run.py
flask run
```
